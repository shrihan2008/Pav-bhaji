1- Boil the veggies first and keep them ready.

2- Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and oil in a large pot on medium heat. Once the butter melts and oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle.

3- Add the chopped onions and mix. I like to use my food processor to chop them really fine.

4- Cook the onions for around 4 minutes until golden brown in color. Add the finely chopped ginger, garlic and green chili. Again, I used my food processor to chop them really fine.

5- Add chopped tomatoes and mix well. Let the tomatoes cook for 2 minutes.

6- Add tomato puree, 1/4 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover the pan and let the tomato cook for 6 minutes until softened and completely cooked.

7- Add the pav bhaji masala, Kashmiri red chili powder, red chili powder and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. You may also add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar here (optional).

8- Mix well and then add in 2 teaspoons of kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves).

9 Stir in the boiled veggies and mix.

10- Using a potato masher, mash the veggies until they are completely mixed with the masala.

11- Add the remaining 3/4 â€“ 1 cup water and mix. I used an immersion blender to blend the veggies to a paste like consistency, this is optional. You may keep them as such.
12- Open the pot and add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.


13- Add a generous amount of chopped cilantro.

14- Then add in juice of 1 large lemon. Let the bhaji simmer for 2 more minutes and then remove pan from heat.

15- To toast the pav, melt butter on a pan. Sprinkle some pav bhaji masala on top of the butter and then place the buns on the pan.

16- Press to toast the pav until crisp and golden brown from both sides.
