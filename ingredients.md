Green Peas. I always add fresh or frozen green peas. The street side bhaji has dried green or white peas which are cooked and mashed. The dried green peas give a different taste and consistency to the bhaji. Feel free to include dried green peas in this recipe

Butter. I personally prefer to use the Indian brand of Amul butter for the bhaji, but you could use any brand or even white butter.

Pav Bhaji Masala. This is a special spice blend that is added into the bhaji. Either buy a good brand of make your own following my recipe of Pav Bhaji Masala

Pav (Dinner Rolls): Pav are soft, fluffy dinner rolls. For the pav you can either make them at home or buy from a good bakery. I usually make Pav a day before when I decide to make pav 
bhaji or when I have Misal Pav on the menu. For health reasons, you can opt for whole wheat dinner rolls.

Mix Vegetables. I add a mix of veggies like cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, capsicum and green peas. The Mumbai street side versions do not have carrots, but I add them for health reasons. They also add very less amount of cauliflower and sometimes omit it completely.
